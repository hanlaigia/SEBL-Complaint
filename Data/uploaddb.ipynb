Not only did I not receive these said notices and instructions. I also have not received any proof of the damaging action of a late payment.The things that are being reported are affecting my business reputation in a negative way. It is causing me higher interest rates and credit denials. It is also causing immense amounts of stress. Which is also hurting me on an emotional, physical and mental level. If this is not rectified within 30 days I will be left with no choice but to further my elevated stress by pursuing legal action exercising my rights in 15 USC 1692 ( b ) ( d ) ( e ) ( k ).

         "For many months now, the transfers that I schedule manually or automatically at Capital One ( Spark for business ) have continued to be either canceled or I get an email stating they are having issues. I believe they are purposely doing this to avoid paying interest. I have called multiple times, and they continue to tell me they are working on it. In the meantime, I can not make interest from the money and must keep it in the checking account. This has happened since the lawsuit against them took place. Before, this was never an issue since the interest rate they provided was so lousy. Now that they have been sued, they are internally doing anything within their power to avoid the money being transferred to their accounts. I just called yesterday from a call I had done in XXXX, and they keep telling me they are working on it. \n\nI was already a victim of forcing me to change my savings account. This company is certainly corrupted. I am going to close all my accounts with them for sure.",

They state they cant lower the interest rate or monthly payments, and they wont waive any fees or interest due. Even if I close my account, theyll still charge me interest while I try to catch up. \nCustomer service states I could pay {$370.00} to postpone a charge off for 30 days. \nI asked what then? So in 30 days were right back where we are now. I need help now Customer service replies there is nothing they are willing to offer. \nI asked what happens when it goes to charge off? Capital One cant discuss it with me until it goes into charge off and THEN the Charge off Dept. can help me. What?? Really? \nThey refused to give me answers and they refused to work with me or help me by refusing to lower payments, interest, or fees. \nI asked if I can speak to someone from the Charge Off Department to discuss what I can do and what will happen. CO Cust. Svc. Rresponded, no, its not possible. That is absurd. I am entitled to understand what happens after Capital One REFUSES to work with me. \nI asked why debt consolidation programs have the option to lower interest on cards but CO wont work with their own customers? Capital One Cust. Svc. responded, there are no options for me except to pay the past due amount of {$2800.00}, that the interest will continue at 27.15 %, they will not lower my rate or payments, and they wont work with me. \nI do not have the income at this time and the hardship will continue for a few years. I dont know when Ill be back on my feet. \nIs the only option bankruptcy? \nCO stated that if I close the account I would be still be charged interest. \nOther banks and credit card company have worked with me. For example, XXXX XXXX closed my account of {$15000.00}, gave me an affordable payment of {$210.00} per month at 1 % interest over five years. \nCapital One will not offer any help at all and refuses to work with me to pay my debt. I will never recommend Capital One again. \nI would like the account closed, the late fees of over {$2000.00} removed from the balance, and I would like a payment of {$250.00} per month at an interest rate of no more than 10 % over a period of 5 to 7 years until paid in full.

Per 15 USC 1666 ( b ) you can not list a payment late on an open account or closed if there is a billing error or unless you can prove with incontrovertible evidence that it was mailed and delivered before 21 days of the due date. No proof has been given or shown and the XXXX party never requested proof to confirm before marking my credit profile with a late payment. Not only did I not receive these said notices and instructions. I also have not received any proof of the damaging action of a late payment.The things that are being reported are affecting my business reputation in a negative way. It is causing me higher interest rates and credit denials. It is also causing immense amounts of stress. Which is also hurting me on an emotional, physical and mental level. If this is not rectified within 30 days I will be left with no choice but to further my elevated stress by pursuing legal action exercising my rights in 15 USC 1692 ( b ) ( d ) ( e ) ( k ). As their choice to not manually perform an investigation and to rely on XXXX  is also causing further damage.

When I log into my app, I am instructed to call ( XXXX ) XXXX to make a payment. When I call ( XXXX ) XXXX I am prompted to confirm the last XXXX of my social security number. Once I confirm the last 4 of my SSN, my call is automatically forwarded to a company called XXXX. I have spoken with XXXX several times and they have informed me that they do not have any information regarding my loan and can not accept any payment from me. I have tried to get connected to someone at Capital One Auto Finance but every number I call results in my call being automatically transferred back to XXXX or an infinite loop of going back to a menu. I have tried calling XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, I have sent emails to XXXX and have sent email requests to Capital One Auto Finance and nobody has responded or informed me how to make my car payment.

I contacted them they write my a very phony response about how their website does not have the proper software to withdraw my money unless I send an addition {$1300.00} to the same cash app. Then they will give me a withdrawal pin. That's when I noticed that, they were going to keep trying to make me send them cash apps without any type of proof of being able to withdraw the \" cryptocurrency '' The lady I was in communication with XXXX, I asked her why she didn't tell me from the beginning that I would need to pay {$1300.00}. She said she forgot, because if I would've known that I could've guessed it was a scam. In total they wanted me to pay them out {$2300.00} and recieve nothing in return. This happened on XX/XX/XXXX the first {$500.00} was sent then on XX/XX/XXXX I sent the next {$500.00}. I made a dispute with XXXX XXXX and capital one. XXXX XXXX hasn't responded and Capital one denied my dispute, I guess they feel like I sent the money voluntarily but I was tricked into seeing a fake XXXX website.",

So in 30 days were right back where we are now. I need help now Customer service replies there is nothing they are willing to offer. \nI asked what happens when it goes to charge off? Capital One cant discuss it with me until it goes into charge off and THEN the Charge off Dept. can help me. What?? Really? \nThey refused to give me answers and they refused to work with me or help me by refusing to lower payments, interest, or fees. \nI asked if I can speak to someone from the Charge Off Department to discuss what I can do and what will happen.

I am entitled to understand what happens after Capital One REFUSES to work with me. \nI asked why debt consolidation programs have the option to lower interest on cards but CO wont work with their own customers?

Svc. responded, there are no options for me except to pay the past due amount of {$2800.00}, that the interest will continue at 27.15 %, they will not lower my rate or payments, and they wont work with me. \nI do not have the income at this time and the hardship will continue for a few years.
